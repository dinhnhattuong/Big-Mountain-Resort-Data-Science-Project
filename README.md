# Big Mountain Resort Pricing Strategy Analysis

## Overview:
This project explores pricing strategies and market positioning for Big Mountain Resort, a ski resort located in Montana. The goal was to provide actionable insights and recommendations to the resort's management team to optimize pricing decisions and enhance competitiveness in the market.

## Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection and Exploration:** Comprehensive data on various features of ski resorts across the United States was gathered, including ticket prices, resort characteristics, and customer metrics. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different variables, identify trends, and understand the competitive landscape.

2. **Baseline Modeling:** The project started by calculating the average ticket price across all resorts to establish a benchmark for comparison. Next, a linear regression model was developed to predict ticket prices based on resort features such as vertical drop, snow-making area, number of chairs, and others. Cross-validation was used to estimate the model's performance, providing a reasonable approximation of actual ticket prices.

3. **Advanced Modeling and Scenario Analysis:** Experimentation with a random forest regressor model demonstrated improved predictive accuracy compared to the linear regression model. Leveraging the trained models, scenario analyses were conducted to explore potential strategies for Big Mountain Resort. Scenarios included adding new facilities, such as runs, chair lifts, and snow-making capabilities, as well as considering the impact of run closures on ticket prices and revenue.

4. **Key Findings and Recommendations:** The modeling results suggested that Big Mountain Resort could potentially increase ticket prices while remaining competitive in the market, particularly by investing in additional facilities such as runs and chair lifts. Recommendations were provided to the resort's management team, emphasizing the importance of strategic pricing decisions aligned with customer value and market demand. Additionally, the analysis highlighted the financial implications of proposed enhancements, including the need to balance investment costs with potential revenue gains and operational efficiencies.

5. **Future Directions:** Future improvements could involve refining the models with more granular data and incorporating additional factors such as customer demographics and preferences. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of pricing strategies and market dynamics will be essential to adapt to changing conditions and maintain competitiveness in the ski resort industry.

## Conclusion:
This project showcased the ability to leverage data-driven insights to inform strategic decision-making and drive business growth. Through comprehensive analysis and modeling, valuable recommendations tailored to Big Mountain Resort's unique market position and objectives were provided, highlighting the potential for optimizing pricing strategies to enhance
